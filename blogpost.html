        <p class="font1">On many blogs, the person reading the posts can leave comments, which are notes in which a
            person says what they think about the blog post.[2] This makes blogs good for discussion â€” if someone writes
            something that someone else does not believe to be true, someone else can fix it by writing a comment on
            that blog or on their own blog. Someone else cannot change what the post says, but the writer of the post
            can. Not all blog posts need to be talked about or fixed. But if there are a lot of people interested in a
            topic, they can start a discussion on the original blog, on their own blogs, or both. These people can
            discuss a topic or their point of view.

            Very often, a community blog or group blog will shrink into a small group of bloggers (writers) who know and
            trust each other, called a creative network. That kind of community blog will also have a larger group of
            people, a social network, who only read (and maybe comment on) the blog. Some blogs have scoring (ranking)
            of posts that makes these networks more solid, so that postings that people like the most are shown first or
            in a way that is easier to find.

            Often people have their own blog and make an RSS feed to it. When blogs have RSS feeds, other programs,
            called content aggregators, can put postings from all the blogs that a person likes in one place. Many
            people find it easier to read all the new posts from blogs they like in one place, through RSS, instead of
            going to each site one at a time.

            Some experts think that community blogs, and some groups of individual (one-person) blogs that talk about
            similar topics, have a power structure like that inside a political party. These experts think that a clique
            (a small, exclusive group of people) will control discussions by choosing when someone has "won" an
            argument, and when a matter is decided. But an advantage of blogs is that even people outside that clique
            can comment on the original discussion.
